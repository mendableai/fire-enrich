## ðŸ”„ LLM Provider Switching

Fire Enrich supports multiple AI providers, allowing you to choose the best model for your needs:

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Default Model | Strengths | Cost | Speed |
|----------|---------------|-----------|------|-------|
| **OpenAI** | `gpt-4o` | High accuracy, reliable | $$$ | Fast |
| **Anthropic** | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` | Excellent reasoning | $$$ | Fast |
| **DeepSeek** | `deepseek-chat` | Cost-effective | $ | Fast |
| **Grok** | `grok-beta` | Real-time data, competitive | $$ | Very Fast |

### How to Switch Providers

1. **Click the LLM switcher** in the top-right corner of the interface
2. **Select your preferred provider and model**
3. **Start enrichment** - the selected provider will be used throughout the entire process

### Provider Selection Tips

- **For maximum accuracy**: Use OpenAI GPT-4o or Anthropic Claude-3.5-Sonnet
- **For cost optimization**: Use DeepSeek for large datasets
- **For speed**: Use Grok for fastest processing
- **For experimentation**: Try different providers to compare results

The entire multi-agent system (Discovery, Profile, Funding, Tech Stack, and General agents) will use your selected provider consistently throughout the enrichment process.

### How Each Agent Works

Behind the scenes, each agent is a specialized module with its own expertise, search strategies, and type-safe output schema:

1. **Discovery Agent** (Phase 1)
   - Establishes company basics: official name, website, type of business
   - Essential first step that provides the foundation for all other agents
   - **Returns**: Company name, website URL, business type
   - **Schema**: `DiscoveryResult` with fields like `companyName`, `website`, `domain`

2. **Company Profile Agent** (Phase 2)
   - Uses verified company name to search for industry and market positioning
   - Builds on Discovery data to ensure accurate industry classification
   - **Returns**: Industry, sub-category, business model, market segment
   - **Schema**: `ProfileResult` with `industry`, `headquarters`, `yearFounded`, `companyType`

3. **Financial Intel Agent** (Phase 3)
   - Leverages company name + industry context for targeted funding searches
   - Knowing the industry helps identify relevant investor databases
   - **Returns**: Funding stage, total raised, key investors, valuation
   - **Schema**: `FundingResult` with `fundingStage`, `totalRaised`, `lastRoundAmount`, `investors`

4. **Tech Stack Agent** (Phase 4)
   - Analyzes technology with context of company type and funding stage
   - HTML analysis, GitHub repos, and technical documentation
   - **Returns**: Programming languages, frameworks, infrastructure, tools
   - **Uses**: Direct `EnrichmentResult` schema for flexible tech stack extraction

5. **General Purpose Agent** (Phase 5)
   - Handles custom fields (like CEO, competitors, etc.) with full context
   - Benefits from all previous data to make targeted searches
   - **Returns**: Any custom field requested by the user
   - **Uses**: Dynamic `EnrichmentResult` schema based on user-defined fields

### Why Sequential Execution?

The agents execute in a carefully designed sequence where each phase builds upon the previous one:

- **Context Building**: Each agent adds context that makes subsequent searches more accurate. For example, knowing a company's industry helps the funding agent search in the right venture databases.
- **Data Validation**: Later agents can validate and refine data from earlier phases.
- **Efficiency**: Prevents redundant searches by sharing discovered information across phases.
- **Parallel Searches Within Phases**: While agents run sequentially, each agent performs multiple searches in parallel, maximizing speed.

This architecture balances accuracy with performance - we could run all agents in parallel, but the sequential approach with shared context produces significantly better results.

### Extensibility Through Type-Safe Schemas

Each agent uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas to ensure type safety and make the system easily extensible:

```typescript
// Example: Adding a new field to the FundingAgent
const FundingResult = z.object({
  fundingStage: z.string().optional(),
  totalRaised: z.string().optional(),
  lastRoundAmount: z.string().optional(),
  investors: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  // Add your new field here:
  debtFinancing: z.string().optional(),
});
```

**To extend Fire Enrich with new data extraction capabilities:**

1. **Add to existing agent**: Modify the Zod schema in `/lib/agent-architecture/agents/[agent-name].ts`
2. **Create a new agent**: Define a new schema and implement the `AgentBase` interface
3. **Update the orchestrator**: Add routing logic to direct fields to your new agent
4. **Use custom fields**: The General Agent handles any field not covered by specialized agents

The field routing system automatically categorizes user requests:
- Fields with "industry" or "headquarter" â†’ Company Profile Agent
- Fields with "fund" or "invest" â†’ Financial Intel Agent  
- Fields with "employee" or "revenue" â†’ Metrics Agent
- Fields with "tech" and "stack" â†’ Tech Stack Agent
- Everything else â†’ General Purpose Agent

This design allows Fire Enrich to grow with your needs while maintaining type safety and predictable behavior.

### Process Flow

1.  **Upload & Parse**: Upload a CSV with emails. The system extracts the company domain from each email.
2.  **Field Selection**: Choose the data points you need, from company descriptions to funding stages.
3.  **Sequential Agent Execution**: Agents activate in phases, each building on previous discoveries for maximum accuracy.
4.  **Parallel Searches Per Phase**: Within each phase, multiple searches run concurrently using the Firecrawl API.
5.  **AI Synthesis**: GPT-4o analyzes all findings, resolves conflicts, and extracts structured data.
6.  **Real-time Results**: Your table populates in real-time, complete with enriched data and source citations.

### The Multi-Agent System

Fire Enrich employs a sophisticated orchestration system that coordinates specialized extraction modules. These aren't autonomous AI agents, but rather purpose-built components that work together intelligently:

-   **Discovery Phase**: Establishes the foundation by identifying the company and its digital presence
-   **Profile Extraction**: Specialized logic for industry classification and business model analysis
-   **Financial Intelligence**: Targeted searches across venture databases and news sources
-   **Technical Analysis**: Deep inspection including HTML parsing and repository analysis
-   **Custom Field Handler**: Flexible extraction for any user-defined data points

Each module uses GPT-4o for intelligent data extraction, but follows deterministic search patterns optimized through extensive testing. This hybrid approach combines the reliability of structured programming with the flexibility of AI-powered comprehension.

### Key Features

-   **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Choose between OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and Grok models with real-time switching.

### Configuration & Unlimited Mode

When you clone and run this repository locally, Fire Enrich automatically enables **Unlimited Mode**, removing the restrictions of the public demo. You can configure these limits in [`app/fire-enrich/config.ts`](app/fire-enrich/config.ts):

```typescript
const isUnlimitedMode = process.env.FIRE_ENRICH_UNLIMITED === 'true' || 
                       process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

export const FIRE_ENRICH_CONFIG = {
  CSV_LIMITS: {
    MAX_ROWS: isUnlimitedMode ? Infinity : 15,
    MAX_COLUMNS: isUnlimitedMode ? Infinity : 5,
  },
  REQUEST_LIMITS: {
    MAX_FIELDS_PER_ENRICHMENT: isUnlimitedMode ? 50 : 10,
  },
} as const;
```

## Our Open Source Philosophy

Let's be blunt: professional data enrichment services are expensive for a reason. Our goal with Fire Enrich isn't to replicate every feature of mature platforms overnight. Instead, we want to build a powerful, open-source foundation that anyone can use, understand, and contribute to.

This is just the start. By open-sourcing it, we're inviting you to join us on this journey.

-   **Add a new agent?** Fork the repo and show us what you've got.
-   **Improve a data extraction prompt?** Open a pull request.
-   **Have a new feature idea?** Start a discussion in the issues.

We believe that by building in public, we can create a tool that is more accessible, affordable, and adaptable, thanks to the collective intelligence of the open-source community.
